git clone https://github.com/Dhanush940/demo.git //Will clone the repository to your local machine.

git config user.email "dhanushkunamaneni123@gmail.com" // For this repository

git add commands.txt //Tracks the changes

Untracked means git doesn't know about the file yet. So to make git know about the file we have to use git add commands.txt

git add . //Telling git to track all the files in the directory

git commit -m "Added commands.txt" -m "Some description" 
//Saved our code only locally . -m stands for message.Ideally the message should have something to do with What and Why behind the commit we are making.

To make the code live we have to use the following command.
git push

cat id_rsa.pub // Outputs the content of the file. pub short for public and you use this key to publish your changes
